Tuples and records
    records are typed tuples, tuples are just data groupers
    A record is a named tuple with classes' capabilities

    A record is a shorthand for -> 'record class'
    There is also a 'record struct'

    A record is a modifier that instructs the compiler to write some methods for you

Types
    All named types in c# are wither an struct or a class
        class -> reference type
        struct -> value type

    Normally structs are used for storing data (encapsulation types)
    And classes for introducing interfaces and polymorphism
